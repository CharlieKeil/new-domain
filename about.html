      Born and raised in Fort St John, British Columbia, later moved to Ottawa Ontario to study the ways of Graphic Design. I specialize in Motion Graphics and UI/UX, but I can still do lots of other cool stuff like illustration and branding! I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of internet cultures (I just really like memes and Social Media). I'm known to be the <i>cool factor</i> of the group, and I can be your cool factor too ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰.
