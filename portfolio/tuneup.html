  <p class="port-p unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 pad-t-2">This was a project for my Interaction Design course. The goal of this project was to create an app for a smart product concept that our classmates came up with. Tune-up connects to the smart device to give you real-time information about your vehicles health and other information such as tire pressure and fuel level, all at your fingertips.</p>
