    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island">This a joint project between my Web development and Interaction Design courses. The objectives of this assignment were to create a website that was able to quickly and fluidly direct the user to the sign up page while giving them all of the necessary information about the SAAS. The concept for the SAAS was created by fellow students and then passed to other students to design the website. The concept I had chosen is called Seakeasy, which is an online language learning tool for all ages. I came up with this design by drawing sketches, making wire frames on Adobe Illustrator, and by conducting usability testing to further refine my design. Below you can see 3 different viewports for the home page.</p>
